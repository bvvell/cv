A CV site should feel confident without shouting. The goal is to give the reader a quick overview and remove friction from the next step: contact or download.

## Small choices, big effect
- Keep the hero area focused on one headline and one action.
- Use generous spacing so sections can breathe.
- Let typography carry hierarchy instead of heavy borders.

When the layout feels calm, the content can do its job.
