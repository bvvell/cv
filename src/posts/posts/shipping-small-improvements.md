Personal sites are alive. They grow with new work, new skills, and new ideas. The trick is to add features that stay aligned with the original tone.

## A lightweight checklist
- Reuse existing spacing and type scales.
- Prefer simple content models that are easy to extend.
- Add a short note on the homepage so visitors can discover updates.

Small improvements, shipped often, are easier to maintain and easier to trust.
